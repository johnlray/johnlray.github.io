### What is the Z-Transformation Doing?

In the statistics class I teach here at UCLA, I find students are often confused by one of the most important parts of statistics: the Z transformation. From a pedagogical standpoint, this is understandable. I am generally nervous every time I try to teach the Z transformation. Not only did I learn it in a confusing way on my first few passes through statistics, but I have tried several different ways of constructing the concept for my students in a way that will most easily help them encode it into their memories, and I don't feel I've quite cracked it yet.
