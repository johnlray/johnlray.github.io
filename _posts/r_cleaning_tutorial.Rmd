In this tutorial, we will be walking through the mechanics of cleaning data. Before that, however, I start by defining the concept of cleaning data and the intution behind why we do it, as well as why we \textit{avoid} other activities commonly thought of as ``data cleaning'' but that actually are not.

**Cleaning data** is the act of preparing a dataset for use in a project for which *the overall dataset was appropriately designed.* Any activity that can be described as 'cleaning data' has the effect of preparing your data for analysis without changing the underlying target population sampled, surveyed, censused, etc. in that dataset. If your dataset is meant to be a representative sample of likely voters on March 20, 2017, cleaning data will allow you to more confidently model that population without changing its scope of inference to, say, likely voters on March 20, 2017 who did not give seemingly silly answers to your survey items.

My definition of the phrase 'cleaning data' leads to what I consider to be the fundamental problem with the most common approach to cleaning data: Some recommended data-cleaning practices fundamentally change the ability to treat a model like as representative of the intended target population. Chief among these is the ultimately arbitrary decision to remove 'outliers.'

The reason why we model in the first place is because we think we know the function that generated part of our data, specifically, the part we model as $Y$ in whatever our equation is. The rest of the data, we assume, is only generated in a normal-ish fashion (if we're running some linear model). That's two assumptions: $Y$ is a function of our $X$s, and our $X$s follow some set of distributions conditional on our modeling assumptions, usually, normalcy. If data is normal, what does that imply about the relative occurence of 'outlier' values?

Say we have some $X$ and that $X$, indeed, meets our normalcy assumption. How much of $X$ will fall within, say, 1.96 standard deviations of its mean? This I suspect you already know the answer to, but just to make sure:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10000, 0, 1)
length(x[x > -1.96*sd(x) & x < 1.96*sd(x)])/length(x)
```
