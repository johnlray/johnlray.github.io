I've been thinking of ways to make a full data course out of one big R project, and the recent [special election in Virginia](https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia_state_legislative_special_elections,_2017) provided just that way. On the day of the election I set up a [dedicated page](https://johnlray.github.io/2017/11/07/election_tracker.html) to gather, format, and plot the results of the election as vote tallies rolled in from the various voting sites across the state. The final version of this project required running one `R` script and committing the subsequent changes to git to

* Update a large dataset gathered from open-source web resources,
* Store them efficiently,
* Use them to generate plots,
* Post those plots to the web.

For this project, we will be walking through how to create such a schema. I have chosen to broke it down into a few smaller parts so that each unit is a discrete learning lesson on one useful topic. Those topics are:

* The use of the grammar of graphics with the `ggplot2` library
* Using R as a GIS
* Acquiring unruly data from a public resource
* Formatting unruly data
* Deploying data visualizations and analysis to the web
* Conducting statistical analysis

Thus, this post is the first in a series that will have six discrete lessons, and then a seventh to put it all together. My goal with seven lessons is to have a more or less finished product that can take the user from being a novice to being very good with `R` in one week's time.
