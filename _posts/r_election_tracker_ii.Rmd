In the previous post, we learned how to acquire spatial data and manipulate it in a few basic but important ways in `R`. We did not run much code in the previous post. Indeed, to get up to speed, the only code you need to run is:

```{r last_time, eval = F}
download.file('http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2016/shp/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k.zip', '~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k.zip')
unzip('~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k.zip', exdir = '~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k')

library(rgdal, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)

shp = readOGR('Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k/', layer = 'cb_2016_51_sldl_500k')

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(shp, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon()
```
