In the previous post, we learned how to acquire spatial data and manipulate it in a few basic but important ways in `R`. We did not run much code in the previous post. Indeed, to get up to speed, the only code you need to run is:

```{r last_time, eval = F}
library(rgdal, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)
library(ggplot2)

download.file('http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2016/shp/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k.zip', '~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k.zip')
unzip('~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k.zip', exdir = '~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k')

shp = readOGR('~/Downloads/cb_2016_51_sldl_500k/', layer = 'cb_2016_51_sldl_500k')

ggplot(shp, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon()
```

It may seem odd to have written so little code for what is supposed to be a tutorial! Code tutorials and `R` tutorials are not the same thing, in my view. In this tutorial I will focus on best practices without presenting the false notion there is only one way to things in this language. The best way to do things in `R` is the way you understand, can do quickly, can replicate, and can share with your teammates. There is consensus on a few general practices, and those are what we will focus on.

The domain of data visualization is one with strong general consensus on practice among `R` users. The library `ggplot2` is the modal means of vata visualization. Indeed, you will find many other libraries that contain their own built-in functions for data viz, that will almost always be simply a custom call to `ggplot2`! One reason for this is that `ggplot2` is based on a theory of data visualization that is quite coherent and logical, and even sensible once you get the hang of it. There are a few papers on the underlying concept, one of them being [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25651297.pdf?casa_token=5f5uQwd-ZZcAAAAA:qu40H1YSwBg7mwKx37vs9Rop8gzo5cY0EeWuTq5H6MFOngy-HoiOpYY-Nfy4lV2GvYG1PGRH9CPpv7gm0sWXXJ7aqtXKZhgp67q9ezdxsFcmYJnsxozE), but the general idea is that there is a, you guessed it, \textbf{g}rammer of \textbf{g}raphics. That grammar is composed of nine distinct types.
